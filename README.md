The Osprangle
=============

The Osprangle is a slightly modified version of the [Osprette V3][osprette-v3], fit for a rectangular case.
The case in question is from the [Equals 60][equals-60] from Boardsource. The keyboard is a 34-key unibody
that runs on any pro-micro compatible daughterboard. It comes with bluetooth support by way of battery
terminals and a power switch.

# Ordering One
